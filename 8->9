The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once
here the file is given 
so directly sort the file then count the occurence of each by using uniq command
type-sort data.txt | uniq -c                            //sort sorts the data in the file
                                                        //| piping does the passing of output of one command to another one
                                                        // uniq -c checks for the repetition of that data and arg 'c' counts its occurenc
the one with 1 as its index is our required password
lvl up!
