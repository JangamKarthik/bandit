The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size
now here everything is same except the file is on the server instead of a directory
if we see our past find commands we used '.' this searched the entire dir now for searching servers we use '/' thats the difference
now use the find command and provide the appropriate args and fetch the file
type- find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
now we get some info on our terminal saying password denied and if we look care fully we get a path to the password 
use cat and read that and we get our password 
type- cat //path
