// The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory
here everything is fine but there is only one challenge there are spaces in the file name
so in order to read these kinda files there is a way i.e
by adding '\' after every word in the filename so that i understands that as the whole word
type- strings spaces\ in\ this\ filename
and you get your required password the next lvl
