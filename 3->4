here the challenge is it is stored in a hidden file in the inhere dir
so first change your current directory to inhere dir 
it can be done by using the command cd
type- cd inhere
now you are in the required inhere directory 
now print the file names in the current directory 
type- ls
you get nothing because the file is hidden so now we need to pass a argument saying list all the files even if it is hidden
so we use '-' to pass an argument
type- ls -a
this will give you the hidden file name
note: all the hidden files name starts with '.'
so copy that name then use cat command
type- cat .hidden            //since my filename was .hidden
you get your required password with this
