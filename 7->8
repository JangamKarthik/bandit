// The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth
now cat the file and grep it 
type- cat data.txt | grep "millionth"                 //cat reads the file 
                                                      //| this is piping operator this takes the output of first command and passes it as an input to the second command
                                                      // grep searches for similar patterns so i passed "millionth" as our password is next to it
copy the password lvl up !
