//The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.
so in order to move ahead we need a password 
this question says there a readme file in the directory so the password is in that file so we need to get that by reading the file
for reading the file there are many ocmmands available so you can fedl free to use them in my case i will use strings command
type- strings readme
now you got the password so just move to the net level by connecting th the next level's address
type- exit              //to exit the current connection
type- clear             //to the previous msgs and commands
type-ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220            //this will reset the connection to level 1
thats it !
