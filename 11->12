 //The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions
the question says all are rotated by 13 positions so the encryption technique used is ROT13
so first use cat and read the file then decode the password using ROT13 decoder
in my case i used - https://rot13.com/
type- cat data.txt                //copy the txt and use the decoder given above
lvl up!
