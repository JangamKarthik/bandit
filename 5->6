The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable
so these were the conditions i mean specifications of the file that contains the password
now first check your current working directory by using pwd command
type- pwd
now change the directory to inhere by using command cd
type- cd inhere
now find the file using find command and giving appropriate arguments
type- find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable                      //we used - to pass args
                                                               //we wrote type f to say that the thing that we are searching for is of file type
                                                               // we wrote size 1033c basically we passed another arg saying that its size is of 1033 and c indicates size in bytes
                                                               // if we dont mention c defaultly it will be considered as size in bits
                                                               //! is used for saying not in any programming langs
                                                               // -executable the whole says not executable
now in my case the file name was ./maybehere07/.file2
now just read the file using cat we get our password
type- cat ./maybehere07/.file2
lvl up!
