now here the question says that the password is in a human readable file in the inhere directory 
so lets try reading it then
first we encounter a messedup terminal right ? 
coz we have been working on the same terminal's page for so many levels
to clear up that mess we can use the command reset
type- reset
now we got a clear terminal
now use the command pwd to know the present directory 
type- pwd
we are not in the inhere directory so use cd command to change the directory
type- cd inhere
now list all the files in the inhere dir
for this i shall use the command ls 
type- ls
now you can see many files in it 
now we need to find which file is a human readable file in all of them 
so type the following commands to get that and refer the appropriate comments for the explanations
type- find . -type f | xargs file                   //find is a command used to find something relevent to the arguments given 
                                                    //we used a '.'this . is used to search accross the whole directory 
                                                    //we used '-' this is used for providing the arguments
                                                    // then type f is basicall mentioning that i am searching for a type f ,f indicates its a file by this i mean i am seaching for a file type in the directory
                                                    //xargs is nothing but saying that i am providing with some extra arguments
                                                    // since it is a human readable file i used file in the last in xargs
after executing this i got a list of files and their content type on my terminal
here in my case file07 contained ascii text so now i am going to read that file and get that password
for reading i am going to use the cat command so
type- cat ./-file07        // since that was my file name
finally we get our required password
level complete!
