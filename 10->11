The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data
okay in this we have base 64 encoded data that is our required password
so we need to decode that in oreder to get our data
so we for that purpose we use the command base64 -d                        //this i found it on the man page
now lets try doing it
type- strings data.txt | base64 -d
this will give you the required password
lvl up!
